# Binaries
Since we don't have RPMs or DEBs yet, this directory has the current pre-built binary for Linux.

## Usage
Just download the binary to your Linux machine and run it.

## Man page
A manpage is available in the man [directory](https://github.com/opsstack/runqstat/tree/master/docs/man) - you can download and show in man directly (man ./runqstat.1)

### Notes
This is 64 bit only. Linux only, though you can develop/test the code on other OS.
